1. Fuel Consumption Estimate
Fuel consumption for an aircraft is typically measured in kilograms per kilometer or gallons per mile. We need to estimate the fuel consumption based on the weight of the plane (which influences fuel consumption).

A general formula for fuel consumption can be:

Fuel consumption (kg per km)
=
Weight (kg)
𝑋
Fuel consumption (kg per km)= 
X
Weight (kg)
​
 
Where:

𝑋
X is a constant that depends on the aircraft's fuel efficiency, generally ranging between 10 and 20. We'll assume a typical value or obtain it based on the aircraft type.
2. Total Fuel Required (kg)
The total fuel required for a flight is based on the distance of the flight and the fuel consumption rate per kilometer:

Fuel needed (kg)
=
Fuel consumption (kg per km)
×
Flight Distance (km)
Fuel needed (kg)=Fuel consumption (kg per km)×Flight Distance (km)
3. Convert Fuel Mass (kg) to Volume (gallons)
Jet fuel, such as Jet-A, has a density of approximately 0.8 kg per liter. To convert from kilograms of fuel to gallons, use the following steps:

Fuel volume (liters)
=
Fuel mass (kg)
0.8
Fuel volume (liters)= 
0.8
Fuel mass (kg)
​
 
Then convert liters to gallons (1 gallon = 3.785 liters):

Fuel volume (gallons)
=
Fuel volume (liters)
3.785
Fuel volume (gallons)= 
3.785
Fuel volume (liters)
​
 
4. Calculate Total Fuel Cost
The total cost of the fuel for the flight is:

Total cost
=
Fuel volume (gallons)
×
Gas price per gallon
Total cost=Fuel volume (gallons)×Gas price per gallon
Full Formula Breakdown
Given your variables:

WeighKG (plane weight in kg)
GasPrice (price of gas per gallon)
FlightDistance (distance of the flight in km)
The total fuel cost can be calculated as:

Fuel consumption (kg/km):

Fuel consumption (kg/km)
=
WeighKG
𝑋
Fuel consumption (kg/km)=

​
 
Where 
𝑋
X is a constant, typically between 10 and 20.

Fuel needed (kg):

Fuel needed (kg)
=
Fuel consumption (kg/km)
×
FlightDistance (km)
Fuel needed (kg)=Fuel consumption (kg/km)×FlightDistance (km)
Convert to gallons:

Fuel volume (gallons)
