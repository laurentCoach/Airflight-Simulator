# Airflight Simulation Project

This project simulates flights between airports, selects planes with sufficient range, and inserts the simulated data into a MySQL database. The project uses SQLAlchemy to manage database interactions, and Python is used to handle simulation logic, including airport and plane selection based on real-world data.
